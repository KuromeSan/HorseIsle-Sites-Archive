<A HREF=/www/detailedrules.php>Detailed Rules</A> (Provides more fine grained policies)
</CENTER><BR>
<font size='3' style='COLOR:#990000'><span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold'>[RULE #1]</span></font><span style='COLOR:#990000'>&nbsp;
</span><b style='COLOR:#990000'>No Obscenities, Inappropriate or Adult Topics</b><br/>
This is an all-ages, friendly environment.&nbsp; Remember that and communicate as
though your mother, grandmother and 7 year old sister were all watching.<br/>

No violent, offensive or inflammatory language.&nbsp; This includes religious
proselytizing, racial comments, ethnic stereotypes, political statements, etc.<br/>
No date-speak allowed. This is not a dating site, no boyfriend/girlfriend talk allowed. This includes talking about or referencing sexual orientation.<BR>
There is a filter set up to only allow words in our dictionary to be used or to change some other words.&nbsp;
DO NOT cheat the filter by going around it.<br/>
Because we need to monitor the chat, all chat must be in English.<BR>
All chat is recorded and monitored by Administrators, <b>including Private Chat</b>.
Keep it clean and family friendly everywhere.<br/>
<b><br/>

<font size='3' style='COLOR:#990000'>[RULE #2]</font><span style='COLOR:#990000'> </span></b><b style='COLOR:#990000'>No
Sharing Personal Info</b><br/>
<b>NEVER share your Horse Isle password!</b>&nbsp; NO ONE from Horse Isle staff will
ever ask it from you.&nbsp; Never enter it on another website either.<br/>
No sharing of email addresses/IM accounts<br/>
No sharing of websites<br/>
No sharing of phone/cell numbers<br/>
No advertising of any kind<br/>
No sharing your age or asking for another player's age<br/>
No sharing real names/home addresses/home towns --&nbsp;
Countries/States/Provinces are as detailed as we permit such communication.<br/>
Limit your contact and friendships to IN-GAME only. This is for your and other
peoples' safety.&nbsp; NEVER trust anyone met online.<br/>
<font size='3'><br style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold'/>

<span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000'>[RULE #3]</span></font><b><span style='COLOR:#990000'> No Ruining Fun For
Others</span><br/>
</b>No harassing/bullying other players.&nbsp; Do not tease, make
fun of, call names, etc.&nbsp; The old, <span style='FONT-STYLE:italic'>'if you
don't have anything nice to say..&nbsp; don't type.'</span>.<br/>

If someone does insult you, DO NOT respond.&nbsp; This will just make the
situation worse.&nbsp; If it was serious (breaking Rule #1) report the person to
a moderator or admin.&nbsp; You can do this directly or by filling out an
'Abuse' report.&nbsp; A recent chat log will be sent with the report, so the
offense must occur within that log.<br/>
Use the MUTE button on players that annoy you.&nbsp; DO
NOT let it escalate to a problem.<br/>
No spamming/flooding chat by repeating the same thing over and over or by typing random letters or symbols.<br/>

There is an auction system, classified ads, and ranch stores to sell horses.&nbsp; Please use that
instead of spamming chat. <br/>
If you must Role Play, you may not advertise or use any public chats.  You may only Role Play using Buddy, Private or Area Chat on a Ranch that is owned by one of those participating in the Role Playing.  Also, all Role Playing must follow the other rules, including being appropriate for all ages.<br/>
<b>This is a positive environment. Anyone not respecting others may receive a chat violation by Admins.</b><br/>
<b><br/>
</b><b style='COLOR:#990000'><font size='3'>[RULE #4]</font> No
Cheating</b><span style='COLOR:#990000'>. </span><br/>

No 'giving away' horses, money or items when you quit the game.  If you do not want to play anymore, everything should remain on your account.<br>
If you find a bug and report it, you will be rewarded, with both respect and
possibly an in-game reward.<br/>
If you find a bug and take advantage of it, that's cheating, and you could lose
your account.<br/>
Only one account allowed per player. Do not move, or help another player move, money/horses to another account.  If you are banned, do not create a new account.  This will be considered multiple accounts and your new account will also be banned.<BR>
Do not use any type of automated click/repetition tools.  Instant permanent ban when detected.<BR>
<br/>
<span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000'><font size='3'>[RULE #5]</font>
Parental Permission</span><br/>
Anyone under 18 should have parental permission to play.&nbsp;<br/>

We <span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold'>REQUIRE</span> anyone under 13 to absolutely
have parental permission.&nbsp;<br/>
Many parents enjoy playing the game with their own account also!<br/>
<br/>
<span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold; COLOR:#990000'><font size='3'>[RULE #6]</font>
Play Smart</span><br/>
Never make a trade on a promise.&nbsp; Always make trades that are fair in
themselves.&nbsp; (Don't give someone one of your horses with their promise they
will give it back, etc.)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/>

Do not trade something you are not willing to lose.<br/>
Do not buy or sell accounts.  This is not only considered trading on a promise, but is an easy way to get scammed.<br>
Never give out your password.&nbsp; Be in the habit of never even typing it
except for when logging into the game.<br/>
Do not share accounts with other players.  Remember you are 100% responsible for your account, so don't let someone else ruin it for you.<br>
Don't EVER EVER EVER agree to meet another player in real life.<br/>
Take breaks.&nbsp; Do not sit and play for hours straight.&nbsp; Try to break up
game time with other activities.&nbsp; This will make the game more fun in the
long run.<br/>

<font size='3'><br/>
<span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold'></span></font><span style='FONT-WEIGHT:bold'><font size='3' style='COLOR:#990000'>Sending
an Abuse Report</font><br/>
</span>The abuse report will send the report that is filled out by the player
along with a short chat log.&nbsp; The broken rule must have occurred within
that chat log.&nbsp; An abuse report should ONLY be sent if it is a serious rule
break.&nbsp; Some examples include harassment, pushing someone for detailed personal
information and getting extreme profanity around the filter.&nbsp; DO NOT send
an abuse report for simple name calling, because another player is annoying you
or a player not being fair with a trade or a player submitted an abuse report against you.&nbsp; The MUTE button is perfect for
the first two situations and if you agree to a trade, even if the player said
they would give the item/horse back, be willing to lose that item/horse in case
they are lying.&nbsp; <B>DO NOT file a fake/non-serious abuse report as you will be penalized
instead of the person you had a problem with!</B> - Abuse reports take a lot of time and effort to deal with, And while we appreciate and manage the serious ones, the non-serious ones waste way too much of our time.  The ABUSE REPORT system is a SERIOUS tool, please treat it as such.<br/>
