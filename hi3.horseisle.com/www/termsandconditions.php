<br>
<hr color='#000000' size='1'>
<font color='#990000'><b>GAMEPLAY:</b></font><br>
 HI3 Is still under heavy development, with many game additions still to come. These will all tweak gameplay and systems players may have grown accustomed to.  We do our best to not make any drastic controversial changes.<BR>
<BR>
 We may change the Gameplay at any time, including, but not limited to the amount of game money, or items, a player receives from game activities or even has on hand and the number of horses a player may have.&nbsp; Any adjustments made to 'Balance' the economy will be done in as fair a manner as possible.&nbsp; In addition we may even (unlikely) have to reset everyones items/stats/horses sometime.&nbsp; If a server becomes too busy we may add more servers, these will be separate virtual 'worlds'. At our discretion we may have to move players to a different server.&nbsp; If players do not agree with these terms of service they should stop playing the game and using the website.<br>
<br>
 Horse Isle Staff and Moderators&nbsp; reserve the right to modify a player's Gameplay if the player has violated Game rules at our discretion.&nbsp; This includes, temporarily kicking a player off of a server, temporarily blocking a player's ability to chat, removing a player's items/objects/horses/money, or permanently blocking a player from future access to the game.
<br><BR>
Horse Isle servers may also limit the total average time allowed online as a precaution against extreme overusage and the detrimental health and general effects this can have.
