3] The only official Clubs in the game are those created using a Token.  No advertising clubs that are not official, as this causes confusion.<br>
4] There can only be one owner of a Club.<br>
5] Ownership of a Club may be transferred only once per year.  This is because an admin must do so by hand.  How the new owner is chosen is up to the current owner.  Contacting Support by opening a Support Issue under the Help button is the only way for ownership to be transferred.<br>
6] No trading should occur until after support has been contacted and the club has been successfully transferred.  Any valuables or money exchanged beforehand, could result in the player being banned.<br>
7] Once ownership is transferred, the original purchaser of the token has no say in what happens to the club and cannot have ownership back without permission from the current owner.<br>
8] The selling of an active Club without contacting Support can result in the banning of the owner's account since it's impossible for ownership to be transferred without admins approval.<p>

<b>Contests</b><br>

2] We do not advise that you hold these or partake in them, but if you choose to, please take note that this is YOUR liability. <br>

2] Horse Isle is not a place to discuss who is "hot" or not, this could result in misunderstandings and disagreements - please do <b>not</b> engage in this sort of topic.<br>
e.g.: <i><b>Player 1:</b> "That singer is sooo hot I love him" <b>Player 2:</b> "No he's not hes ugly!!" <b>Player 1:</b> "You hurt my feelings .. -cry cry cry-"</i>.<br>
3] Please do not share, discuss or reference your sexual orientation.<br>

<b>Dungeon</b><br>
1] When an area (island, inside a building, etc) has over 75 people on it, players can call !TOOCROWDED.  This sends everyone in the area to the Dungeon.<br>
2] If a player wants to go to the Dungeon on their own there is a NPC (non-player character) that will send them.<br>
3] If for some reason, players want to get others together to send a group to the Dungeon they may only do so on a ranch isle.  If they advertise for this, it must be on the advertiser's ranch.<br>
4] Calling for players to gather on a normal isle is not allowed since many players may need to be there to quest and don't want to go to the Dungeon.<p>

<b>Help</b><br>
1] If you need help please always remember to refer to the Help pages provided to you on the Horse Isle MAIN page (hi2.horseisle.com) first.<br>
2] Remember that most questions that you need help with are ALL covered in the Help section.<br>
3] If you are unable to find your answer there, you may ask a question using the Help System within the game by clicking on the HELP button.<br>
4] Players MAY ask for their classified ad or art to be reviewed via the helper system, however, please try buddies first.  Also realize that those answering the 'question' will not receive any helper points for this.<br>
5] Do <b>NOT</b> abuse the Help System.  This means asking pointless questions in an attempt to help a buddy or friend get more helper points.<br>
6] If we find evidence of the Help System being abused, all players involved will receive violations and lose any helper points they have accrued.<p>

<b>Harassment</b><br>
1] The definition of harassment: "to disturb persistently; torment, as with troubles or cares; bother continually; pester; persecute." (Dictionary.com)<br>
2] Harassment is STRICTLY against the rules, do NOT engage in it.<br>
3] If someone is harassing you, please ask them kindly to stop, if they do not, immediately Personally Mute the player, and file an abuse report. <br>
4] If another player asks you to Personally Message another player because they have been muted, kindly tell them you will <b>not</b> interfere, there is a good reason they were personally muted. <p>

<b>Hunting for Wild Horses in a Group</b><br>
1] We do not encourage players to hunt for Wild Horses in groups.<br>
2] If a horse is free roaming and uncaught, it is considered a Wild Horse.<br>
3] If two players both find this horse, the person who catches it, OWNS it. This means that wild horses cannot be "stolen" from someone else- it's "catchers keepers!"<br>
3] Once a player starts catching a horse, no one else can try catching it until that player either catches it, or time runs out.  If the player fails to catch it the first time, he/she must wait until either after the next person fails, or 2 minutes.<br>
4] Please do <b>NOT</b> harass or beg a player if they caught the Wild Horse before you did, it belongs to the player who first caught it.<br>
5] If another player does harass or beg you for it, kindly tell them no, and nicely ask them not to continue asking.<br>
6] If the player continues, Personally Mute them immediately without further responding and file an Abuse Report.<p>

<b>Muted by Another Player</b><br>
1] If another player has muted you, do NOT attempt to contact them in any other way.<br>
2] Do not ask friends to contact the player who has muted you, this validates as harassment.<br>
3] There is a good reason why another player muted you so please move on and ignore them yourself.<p>

<b>Personally Muting Other Players</b><br>
1] If another player is bothering you, making you angry or upset in any way please use the Personal Mute feature, do <b>not</b> respond in a harsh or rude manner.  Please simply just Personally Mute the player to avoid conflict or stress to yourself. <br>
2] You can use this feature by clicking the "PLAYERS" button (next to the "HORSES" button which you use to view your horses), and by clicking "List Players Alphabetically". Next to the player's name you will see a "MUTE" button, click it. <br>
3] Players <b>cannot</b> do the following when they are muted by you: Contact you in any way (e.g.: by sending you mail), engage in socials, etc.<p>

<b>Muted by a Moderator</b><br>
1] Muting is a form of punishment used by Moderators or Admin in order to try and stop a specific action performed by a player. <br>
2] Being muted results in ALL of the chats being barred from use by a player for a given period of time depending on severity.<br>
3] If you are muted, you will be notified as to what you did wrong and for how long you were muted, you will also gain violation points accordingly.<br> 
4] If you have been muted, please accept that you have broken a rule - please do not argue as to why you have been muted. <p>

<b>Moderators</b><br>
1] A Horse Isle Moderator is someone who is enabled to enforce the rules of Horse Isle - someone who mediates disputes and attempts to avoid conflict.<br>
2] Players cannot ask to become a moderator, the site Admins will look for helpful players meeting requirements on their own.<br>
3] Moderators are in place in order to enforce rules and keep the game <b>enjoyable</b> for all.<br>
4] Always assure that you listen carefully to a Horse Isle Moderator, Moderators speak in GREEN text on the Area chat and their names are outlined in green.<br>
5] <b>NOTE:</b> If you feel that a Moderator is treating you unfairly in any way, please file a legitimate Abuse Report.<br>
6] Players who are <b>not</b> Moderators: Please do <b>not</b> attempt to correct other players who have broken a rule - this only singles out the player in question, this is a Moderator's job, and not at all expected of you. <br>
7] Most of the time you will <b>not</b> see a Moderator correcting or warning a player - Moderators correct, or warn using a <b>Personal Message</b> - Please do not assume a Moderator is not dealing with a problem.<br>
8] Friends of Moderators: Please do <b>NOT</b> at any time expect any special treatment towards yourself, you are NOT excluded from the rules, and if you are violating a rule, the Moderator is <b>expected</b> to take action immediately. Moderators giving their friends special treatment will have their status removed.<br>
9] Moderators are not required to help other players - Moderators are players like everyone else. Sometimes they are busy, or working on their own things and Moderators are under <b>no obligation</b> to help. DO NOT be upset when they do not have time to help you, and be grateful when they do. Try making your requests for help to anyone on the server if it's a general game issue. <p>

<b>Multiple Accounts</b><br>
1] Owning more than one account per player is strictly against the rules and is considered cheating. <br>
2] If you already own more than one account, please notify Admin immediately, to have it deleted. Failure to do so will result in both accounts being deleted and all of your items lost. <br>
3] Players may not move money, items or horses from one account to another. Doing so is considered cheating and will result in losing everything that was moved if not losing both accounts completely.<br>
4] A Multiple account is when you sign up for more than one playername; e.g.: JackFrost, JackFrostOne, JackFrostTwo, etc.<p>

4] That being said, you cannot predict when a specific player will be online, and therefore can never expect them to be online at a certain time.<br>

<b>Quests</b><br>
1] You may ask for help with quests in any chat medium.  However, please ask for the help to be given to you via Personal Message.<br>

3] If the Story violates any rules in any way, please file an Abuse report immediately.<br>
4] This note stands for Forums as well, should your Forum post violate rules, the post will be removed immediately. <p>

<b>Stuck</b><br>
1] It can be possible to get stuck in the game.  Especially if you try to squeeze between world objects that are relatively close together or near the edge of the 'world'.<br>
2] Never try to purposefully get stuck.  However, if it happens, type !STUCK and it will nudge you a little to try and get you unstuck.<br>
3] If that does not work, contact a moderator.  They have the ability to jump you nearby to get you unstuck.<br>
4] Never abuse the !STUCK command.  Should we find you getting yourself stuck purposefully, you will be left for a while to just sit.  If this does not deter you, it's possible to receive a ban from the game for one day as this not only causes confusion among the players, but it also wastes the time of the moderators and admins.<p> 

<b>Suggestions</b><br>
1] Suggestions are well appreciated, but keep in mind that it takes a lot of work to get most suggestions in effect.<br>
2] Admin do review all suggestions - they should be reasonable as it is not possible for some ideas to be carried out.<br>

<b>Training</b><br>
1] The leasing system is set up to make it safe to lease a horse to another player for boarding or training purposes.  Do Not directly Trade the horse to another player.<br>
2] Horse Isle does not advise that you pay for training ahead of time, however it does not prohibit it.  If you prepay, realize you are trading on a promise and could lose that money should the trainer not do the agreed upon training, or cancel the lease early without training.<br>
3] Horse Isle does not advise that the trainer wait to take payment until after the training is completed as that is also trading on a promise and you could be out the money it cost you to train that horse.<br>
4] If you have another player Experience train your horse, it is highly advised to use the Experience Training Contract.  This is set up so both players do not lose money in the end.  If a player refuses to use this system, it is advisable to not make a deal with them.  If you do not use this system, it is considered trading on a promise, and the above statements apply.<br>
5] If you do Stat or Experience training without using the contract system, you do so at your own risk since it is considered trading on a promise.<br>
6] If it is clear to staff that you have not fulfilled your end of a training agreement, you will be banned.<p>

<b>Terms Of Service</b><br>
1] Please assure that you have read and that you understand fully our Terms of Service. By joining you agree to accept them, and you agree to follow all rules. <br>
2] If you are under the age of 18 and do not understand the Terms of Service, please ask a parent or guardian to help you through them.<br>
3] It is <b>extremely</b> important that you understand the Terms of Service. <p>

<b>Threats</b><br>
1] Please do <b>NOT</b> engage in threatening another player in any way, this is strictly against the rules. <br>
2] If someone is threatening you, please Personally Mute the player immediately and file an Abuse Report. <p>

<b>Trading Between Games</b><br>
1] Trading between the Horse Isle games (Secret Land of Horses/HI1 and Legend of the Esrohs/HI2) is not recommended or endorsed by Horse Isle.<br>
2] Trading between the games includes, but is not limited to, getting money on one game for a specified amount of money on the other game.<br>
3] This is considered trading on a promise and not a good idea.  Should you decide to do this anyway, realize Horse Isle will not return any stolen funds to you should someone not complete their end of the deal.<br>
4] If a player does agree to trade with you and they do not follow through, please do file an abuse report, but again, you will not get your money, items or horses back.<br>
5] Because this is trading on a promise and not advised, advertising is not allowed.<p>

<b>Trading on a Promise</b><br>
1] Trading on a promise is when one player gives something to another under the promise that the other will do their half of the trade, or return the traded item, at a later time.<br>
2] Horse Isle strongly advises to never do a trade on a promise.  Always be sure a trade is fair in and of itself.<br>
3] Trading on a promise includes, but is not limited to: trading between HI1 and HI2, boarding a horse with another player not using the leasing system, lending items/pets/money, trading an item/horse/money with the player promising to pay you back later, having a horse trained without using the in-game system.<br>
4] If you do complete a trade on a promise and the other player does not fulfil their end of the deal, please file an Abuse Report immediately.<br>
5] Horse Isle does not return items/horses/pets/money that have been stolen.  So be very sure you are happy with a trade before you accept it.<p>

<b>Too Crowded</b><br>
1] When an area (island, inside a building, etc) has over 75 people on it, players can call !TOOCROWDED.  This sends everyone in the area to the Dungeon.<br>
2] If a player wants to go to the Dungeon on their own there is a NPC (non-player character) that will send them.<br>
3] If for some reason, players want to get others together to send a group to the Dungeon they may only do so on a ranch isle.  If they advertise for this, it must be on the advertiser's ranch.<br>
4] Calling for players to gather on a normal isle is not allowed since many players may need to be there to quest and don't want to go to the Dungeon.<p>

6] If you acquire 10 violations or more, you may be given a temporary warning ban.  Take that time to go over the rules and be sure you understand them so you do not acquire more once your ban is up.<br>
7] If, after you have had a temporary ban, you receive more violations, you may be given a longer temporary ban, or a permanent ban from the game.<br>

<b>Wild Horses</b><br>
1] If a horse is free roaming, and uncaught it is considered a Wild Horse.<br>

3] Please do NOT harass or beg a player if they caught the Wild Horse before you did, it belongs to the player who first caught it.<br>
4] If another player does harass or beg you for it, kindly tell them no, and nicely ask them not to continue asking.<br>
